## Project Title:
**UML Modelling of a Property Rental System in the UK  

## Coursework Description:
A comprehensive UML-based analysis and design of a **Property Rental System in the UK**, using the Unified Modelling Language (UML). The system aims to support the property rental lifecycle—from user registration and property listing to search, rental agreement, and review submission.

The following UML artifacts were created using **StarUML** and incorporated into the final report:
1. **Use Case Diagram** – Identifies actors, use cases, and their relationships.
2. **Use Case Description** – Structured English description for the **Rent Property** scenario using sequence, selection, and iteration.
3. **Class Diagram** – Shows system structure with classes, attributes, operations, and relationships.
4. **Sequence Diagram** – Demonstrates dynamic interactions based on the **Rent Property** use case and class diagram.

## Tools Used:
- **StarUML**: All UML diagrams were designed and exported using StarUML as per coursework requirements.
- **Microsoft Word**: Final report compilation.
- **Optional**: draw.io / Lucidchart (for draft or concept diagrams)
